        "When a catalogue item is selected, base price and GST are auto-filled from the selected Item Master record (existing behavior is preserved).",
        "When a custom/manual description is entered, the description field accepts free text and does not require a matching Item Master entry.",
        "Switching between catalogue selection and manual entry for the same line item updates the stored `description` value correctly and does not break total calculations.",
        "Bill Preview displays the manually entered description exactly as entered, and it is included in the saved bill data and generated PDF output (via the existing draft/save flows)."
