  "summary": "REQ-1 is largely implemented: a single APP_NAME constant was added and reused for nav brand text, start page heading, logo alt text, footer copyright, and document title updates on route changes. However, the diff also introduces new footer attribution/branding content that was not requested and may violate the non-goals/constraints about limiting changes to app-name consistency.",

    {
      "description": "Added a new footer attribution line/link (“Built with ❤️ using caffeine.ai”) and related outbound tracking URL logic, which is unrelated to app-name consistency and changes visible branding/identity beyond the app name.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly limits scope to app-name rendering/usage consistency and lists rebranding/visual identity changes beyond app-name text consistency as non-goals. Adding a new attribution line and link is additional UI/branding not requested.",
